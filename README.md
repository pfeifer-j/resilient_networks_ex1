# Resilient Networks: Graph Theory Exercise Sheet

## Overview
This exercise sheet is part of the Resilient Networks course, aiming to recapitulate the lecture on graph theory and apply this knowledge to real-world graphs. Students are encouraged to familiarize themselves with established metrics and techniques to describe a given network graph.

## Instructors
- Prof. Dr. Mathias Fischer
- August See

## Tasks
### 1. Graph Analysis
- Analyze at least two graphs based on specified metrics.
- Implement the metrics calculation in a programming language of your choice.
- Choose two graphs from the provided options or any appropriate alternative.
- Calculate at least five metrics and discuss their implications.

#### Used Graphs
- Directed: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/p2p-Gnutella09.html
- Undirected: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/feather-lastfm-social.html

#### Suggested Metrics
- Power-law properties
- Characteristic path length
- Density
- Average clustering coefficient & distribution
- Distribution of Cohesiveness
- Edge persistence under greedy attack
- Resilience/Survivability against various attacks

#### Used Tools
- Python libraries: [igraph](https://igraph.org/python/) and [networkx](https://networkx.github.io/)
