    "## Introduction\n",
    "- In this exercise, we explore and analyze resilient networks using Python and the igraph library. We aim to compute and analyze network metrics for the given dataset.\n",

    "## Hints on Tools and Libraries\n",
    "- Programming Language: Python 3\n",
    "- Libraries: igraph, os\n",
